Digit Recognition

The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images .
The entire nueral network is built from scratch and is 4 layers deep with regularization and bias to it. It has relu activation function to the first 3 layers and softmax to the last layer. There is a directory that contains the dataset, a directory that contains scripts consisting of activation functions, accuracy, one hot encoding and to load the dataset. There is also a plot between Cost and Iterations.
